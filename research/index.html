    <h1>Fast Radio Bursts</h1>
<p>Fast Radio Bursts (<a href="http://www.frbcat.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">FRBs</a>) are a new type of radio transients, yet, with unknown origins. The bursts last for a few milliseconds, and show dispersive signatures with peak flux densities ranging from 0.3 Jy to about 100 Jy. As a new class of astronomic transients, has fascinated a lot of astrophysicists’ attentions during this decade. The first FRB (Lorimer Burst) was discovered serendipitously in Parkes Pulsar Survey.

<p>Later on, following high time-resolution surveys yield a growing number of detections. With the repeating finding, the FRB host galaxy was identified at cosmological distance firstly. Since that, theoretical models start to evolve from cataclysmic ones to repeatable events. However, the exact nature of FRBs is still a mystery. Though the difficulties in FRB search are not easily handled, new FRB surveys equipped with developed instruments are preparing for being online. The era of FRB large sample is hoped to come up soon.

<h1>Pulsars</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/pulsar/psrcat/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pulsars</a> are highly magnetized rotating compact stars (neutron stars or white dwarfs, maybe quark stars) that emit beamed electromagnetic radiation. We can observe a pulsar with periodic arrival pulses like lighthouse.

&lt;/div&gt;

<p>As one of top four discoveries in 1960s, research on pulsars has contributed to two Noble Prize in physics. Theses highly spinning neutron stars provide natural laboratories to explore the equation of states of extremly compact matter. Owing to accuracy of pulse arrivals, millisecond pulsars are widely used in astrophysics. High-precision timing on millisecond pulsars in binaries help physicists to test gravity theories, whether general relativity is still correct in strong gravitational field. In addition, measuring the time of arrival of pulsars from different directions is the unique approach to detect nano-hertz gravitational waves from distant universe, it's so-called pulsar timing array (<a href="http://www.ipta4gw.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">PTA</a>).
