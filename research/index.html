    <h1>Fast Radio Bursts</h1>
<p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are a new type of radio transients, yet, with unknown origins. The bursts last for a few milliseconds, and show dispersive signatures with peak flux densities ranging from 0.3 Jy to about 100 Jy.</p>
<p>As a new class of astronomic transients, has fascinated a lot of astrophysicists’ attentions during this decade. The first FRB was discovered serendipitously in Parkes Pulsar Survey. Later, following high time-resolution surveys yield a growing number of detections. With the repeating finding, the FRB host galaxy was identified at cosmological distance firstly. Since that, theoretical models start to evolve from cataclysmic ones to repeatable events. Though the difficulties in FRB search are not easily handled, new FRB surveys equipped with developed instruments are preparing to be online. The FRB large sample era is coming soon hopefully.

<h1>Pulsars</h1>
<p>Pulsars, as extremely accurate clocks, are widely used in astrophysics. As one of top 4 dicoveries in 1960s, pulsars studies have contributed to two Noble Prize in physics. Theses highly spinning neutron stars provide natural laboratories to explore the equation of states of extreme compact matter. High precision timing on pulsars in binaries help us to test gravity theories, whether general relativity is still correct in strong gravitational field. In addition, measuring the arrivial time of pulsars from different directions is the unique approach to detect nano-hertz gravitational waves from distant universe, it's so-called pulsar timing array (PTA).</p>
