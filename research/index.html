    <h1 id="Fast-Radio-Bursts"><a href="#Fast-Radio-Bursts" class="headerlink" title="Fast Radio Bursts"></a>Fast Radio Bursts</h1><p>Fast Radio Bursts (<a href="http://www.frbcat.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">FRBs</a>) are a new type of radio transients, yet, with unknown origins. The bursts last for a few milliseconds, and show dispersive signatures with prominent flux densities. As a new class of astronomic transients, has fascinated a lot of astrophysicists’ attentions during this decade. The first FRB (Lorimer Burst) was discovered serendipitously in Parkes Pulsar Survey. </p>

<p>Later on, following high time-resolution surveys yield a growing number of detections. With the repeating finding, the FRB host galaxy was identified at cosmological distance firstly. Since that, theoretical models start to evolve from cataclysmic ones to repeatable events. However, the origin(s) of FRBs is still a mystery at present. New facilities with large field of view and good sensitivity are commencing FRB surveys, FRB science is entering epoch of large sample. We are optimisitc that emerging localizations will shed light on the FRB true nature in the near future.</p>

<h1 id="Pulsars"><a href="#Pulsars" class="headerlink" title="Pulsars"></a>Pulsars</h1><p><a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/people/pulsar/psrcat/" target="_blank" rel="external">Pulsars</a> are highly magnetized rotating compact stars (neutron stars or white dwarfs, maybe quark stars) that emit beamed electromagnetic radiation. We can observe a pulsar with periodic arrival pulses like lighthouse. </p>

<p>As one of top four discoveries in 1960s, research on pulsars has yielded two Noble Prize in Physics. Such highly spinning neutron stars provide natural laboratories to explore the equation of states of extremly compact matter. Owing to the accuracy of pulse arrivals, millisecond pulsars are widely studied in astrophysics. High-precision timing on millisecond pulsars in binaries is used to test gravity theories in strong gravitaional fields. More importantly, long-term precise timing for pulsars from different directions is the unique tool to detect nano-hertz gravitational waves from the distant universe, i.e. Pulsar Timing Array (<a href="http://www.ipta4gw.org/" target="_blank" rel="external">PTA</a>).</p>

<h1 id="RFI"><a href="#RFI" class="headerlink" title="RFI"></a>RFI</h1><p>It’s inevitable for radio astronomers to deal with a variety of radio frequency interference (<a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/radio-frequency-interference/" target="_blank" rel="external">RFI</a>). Since the electromagnetic environment is becoming worse and worse around the world, RFI mitigation is becoming, to some extent, the future of radio astronomy. </p>

<h1 id="Deep-Learning"><a href="#Deep-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Deep Learning"></a>Deep Learning</h1><p>In recent years, a growing number of machine learning techniques have been applied in the data science of astronomy. For time-domain radio data sets, convolutional neural network (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" target="_blank" rel="external">CNN</a>) is playing a more and more important role in data reduction and candidates selection.</p>
